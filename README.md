# Binary Tree
A binary tree is a tree-type non-linear data structure with a maximum of two children for each parent. Every node in a binary tree has a left and right reference along with the data element. The node at the top of the hierarchy of a tree is called the root node. The nodes that hold other sub-nodes are the parent nodes.<br>

Every binary tree node has these three components associated with it. 
1. Data element
2. Pointer to left subtree
3. Pointer to right subtree<br>

These three binary tree components represent a node. The data resides in the middle. The left pointer points to the child node, forming the left sub-tree. The right pointer points to the child node at its right, creating the right subtree. 

<h2>Types of Binary Trees</h2>

1. Full Binary Tree
2. Perfect Binary Tree
3. Complete Binary Tree
4. Degenerate or Pathological Tree
5. Skewed Binary Tree
6. Balanced Binary Tree

<h3>1. Full Binary Tree</h3> A full Binary tree is a special type of binary tree in which every parent node/internal node has either two or no children. <br>

<h3>2. Perfect Binary Tree</h3> A perfect binary tree is a type of binary tree in which every internal node has exactly two child nodes and all the leaf nodes are at the same level.

<h3>3. Complete Binary Tree</h3> A complete binary tree is just like a full binary tree, but with two major differences

1. Every level must be completely filled
2. All the leaf elements must lean towards the left.
3. The last leaf element might not have a right sibling i.e. a complete binary tree doesn't have to be a full binary tree.

<h3>4. Degenerate or Pathological Tree</h3> A degenerate or pathological tree is the tree having a single child either left or right.

<h3>5. Skewed Binary Tree</h3> A skewed binary tree is a pathological/degenerate tree in which the tree is either dominated by the left nodes or the right nodes. Thus, there are two types of skewed binary tree: left-skewed binary tree and right-skewed binary tree.

<h3>6. Balanced Binary Tree</h3> It is a type of binary tree in which the difference between the height of the left and the right subtree for each node is either 0 or 1.
